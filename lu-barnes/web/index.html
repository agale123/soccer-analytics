      <div id="step-0">
        The Reign (Seattle Reign, Reign FC, and OL Reign) have played X regular
        season NWSL games since 2013. There are three "Reign Originals" who have
        been on the roster the whole time:
        <span class="bold">Jess Fishlock</span>,
        <span class="bold">Megan Rapinoe</span>, and
        <span class="bold">Lauren Barnes</span>. Each hexagon represents one
        game.
      </div>
      <div id="step-1">
        Of those X Reign games, Lauren Barnes has played in
        <span class="bold">X% of games</span>, making her the first NWSL player
        to hit 200 caps. Games she played are highlighted in blue.
      </div>
      <div id="step-2">
        Of these 200 matches played by Lauren Barnes, the Reign have
        <span class="blue">won X</span>, <span class="gold">tied Y</span>, and
        <span class="red">lost Z</span> games.
      </div>
      <div id="step-3">
        Barnes has only played left back and center back, often rotating between
        the seasons. Recently, she has almost exclusively played left back.
        Hexagons are shaded to show the positioning, with the darker strip
        representing where on the field she played (left versus center).
      </div>
      <div id="step-4">
        In addition to playing in most of the Reign game, she has also played
        the most minutes. Lauren Barnes has played full 90s in all but X matches
        for a total of <span class="bold">Y minutes</span> in the regular
        season. Hexagons are scaled proportionally to the minutes played in each
        match.
      </div>
      <div id="step-5">
        The Reign managed to hold their opposition to a shutout in
        <span class="bold">X games</span> that Barnes played in. Hexagon borders
        represent goals scored by both teams with a solid line representing a
        shutout and the grey portion of the dashed lines representing opposition
        goals.
      </div>
      <div id="step-6">
        She has a total of <span class="bold">X assists</span> across all
        matches. These are represented by the three-petal flowers over certain
        matches.
      </div>
      <div id="step-7">
        While defender goals are less common, she scored
        <span class="bold">X goals</span>, including
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjucGayDEe0" target="_blank"
          >this goal</a
        >
        which was a nominee for goal of the week. Goals are represented by
        six-petal flowers.
      </div>
      <div id="step-8">
        Lauren Barnes was a key piece that contributed towards the Reign winning
        the NWSL Shield 3 times, in 2014, 2015, and 2022.
