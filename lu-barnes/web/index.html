        The Reign (Seattle Reign, Reign FC, and OL Reign) have played X regular
        season NWSL games since 2013. <span class="bold">Lauren Barnes</span> is
        one of three "Reign Originals" who have been on the roster the whole
        time. Each hexagon represents one game.
      </div>
      <div id="step-1">
        Of those X Reign games, Lauren Barnes has played in
        <span class="bold">X% of games</span>, making her the first NWSL player
        to hit 200 caps. Games she played are highlighted in blue.
      </div>
      <div id="step-2">
        Of these 200 matches played by Lauren Barnes, the Reign have
        <span class="blue">won X</span>, <span class="gold">tied Y</span>, and

      <div id="step-3">
        Lauren Barnes has only played left back and center back for the Reign.
        Since 2022, she has almost exclusively played left back. Hexagons are
        shaded to show the positioning, with the darker strip representing where
        on the field she played (left versus center).

        In addition to playing in almost all Reign games, Lauren Barnes has also

        The Reign held their opposition to a
        <span class="bold">X shutouts</span> in these games, indicated by solid
        color borders. Dashed borders represents goals scored by both teams and
        a solid grey border means only the opposition scored.
      </div>
      <div id="step-6">
        Lauren Barnes has a total of <span class="bold">X assists</span> across
        all matches. These are represented by a three-petal flowers in the

        <span class="bold">X goals</span>, including
