# USWNT Ages

Analysis of USWNT performance relative to the age distribution of the roster.

## Findings

Each box and whisker plot represents the age distribution of the USWNT for a major tournament. The box plots are color coded based on the finish of the USWNT with the white plots representing years where they failed to medal.

Not all rostered players see the same game time. This plot takes a weighted average of player age based on how many minutes each player played in the tournament. A linear regression best fit line shows how that weighted average of age has increased since 2000.

The following two plots show how many goals were scored and assists were made by players of each age. Goal scorers tend a bit younger while assisters tend a bit older.
